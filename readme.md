# Verions
## Java
- Java 1.8 and higher
### Run
- Use run.bat, which launches the .jar
### Notes
- Adding and Multiplying 2 ints will mitigate via long and BigIntege, and output will write result regardless but warn with (Overflow Detected).
## Python
- Tested with Python 3.11 (but probably works with lower)
### Dependencies
- autopep8==2.0.2
- bcrypt==4.0.1
### Run
- Use run.bat, which will ask to pip install dependies and launch the .py
### Notes
- Adding and Multiplying 2 ints can't overflow because python arbitrary ints. Output will still write (Overflow Detected) though.

# Shortcomings
- Get input and output files probably has some vulnerability.
